        <p><img alt="Mozilla Trichy Inaguration Meetup" src="" /></p>
<p>So here I am a usual college kid with no clue about what I would like to persue or achieve in life.The Only two things I was proud of was joining an Engineering College and my intermediate skills in playing games.</p>
<p>Was I the only one ? Or are there a lot of kids out there like me who thought playing games and chatting online made you a good computer user or even at certain instances a "Pro" in computer usage.So this the part which turned my life upside down for the rest of time.</p>
<p>It was on July 24,2015 That I got a call from one of my friends from the NGO I was on. He told me that there was going to be a meetup in TRICHY conducted by THE "Mozilla!".Obviously a common guy like me with no expertise in the field of Contribution the Community Projects would freak out and would want to attend the meeting.</p>
<p>Here's the catch,Two days before his call was when I got a serious Swelling in my mouth due to infection and my lips were in the size of a piece of Orange.As all teenagers would do I started a mini-war in my head on whether or not I should go to this meetup.Obviously we would finally seek an elder's advice which will obviously destroy all hopes we had about going to the meetup.</p>
<p>That's when I found out how much I wanted to go there!,So I called my friend who picked me up on his bike and we went there. After the initial 10 minutes of ice-breaking, I was in full swing. I was good at debating but I didn't know I had this much passion for understanding and contribution to Open Software Communities.</p>
<p>I got to meet Vigneshwer who is a Mozilla rep who was travelling all around,gathering contributors all around the Southern part of TamilNadu.My Friend Makilan was there as well,He is part of the Mozilla Tanjore Community and last but not least the "Lil dude" Subbu was there. Initially we were supposed to start contibuting to firefox and spread the word out that we are here to support users if and when they needed help.So I took it upon myself to start working my way up as a good contributor and this is how my journey as a Firefox Student Ambassador began. </p>
<p>I feel like it was by mere coincidence that I got into Mozilla as a Firefox Student Ambassador but in the end is there any such thing called coincidence ? </p>
