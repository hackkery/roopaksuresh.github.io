        <p>I'm so excited,Finally met Abhiram after three months.He is one of the few people I know who is down to Earth and supports a new FSA with even the most basic of things.So before we go into what happened in the meeting I'd like to let you guys know what I've done in these three months as a Firefox Student Ambassador.</p>
<p>I was told that Mozilla Location Services,was the hot topic during that duration.One of the ways to contribtue was to use the Mozilla stumbler app and scan for new cells using the Wifi on our android phones.Here's the catch,I didn't have a so called "Android" phone when this was happening,and no I didn't have one of those Nokia 1100's as well. I was stuck with one of those windows phones which had apps which were last updated during the STONE AGE.I felt hopeless when I wasn't able to stumble.Also the second problem was as I pointed out I wasn't able to move to Telegram since the app they had was last updated long ago.</p>
<p>I was still fairly new to the community and had no experience about github and all those other stuff.All I knew was the common C and C++ from School,but was good enough to write my own programs.This was the time I decided to explore the community and that's how I got to know Abhiram.</p>
<p>Lucky for me he had a friend's wedding here at Trichy so he decided to keep a meetup at NIT-Trichy's Cafe Coffee Day in the Evening after the wedding day.So as usual my eagerness got the better of me and I started procrastinating and started overimagining about how the meetup is gonna be what is going to happen and what I'd end up doing also those kind of stuff.So I had to slowly move back to normalcy and started getting ready to go to the meetup.</p>
<p>As I live fairly near NIT it was like a 10 minute bus travel for me to reach there,(Grandparents won't let me drive the bike as they are afraid something would happen to me eventhough I'm 19).After boarding the bus to my surprise my little friend subbu was travelling on the same bus.So as usual we started arguing on random stuff and reached NIT.
We had to wait an agonizing 30 minutes until we met Abhiram,Bhoomika,Rishav and Jayresh.
Unlike me and Subbu these people have contributed a lot to Mozilla and know what they are talking about. </p>
<p>So I grabbed the oppurtunity I had and started learning as much as I could from them.I really have to appreciate them for their patience and kindness.It was a 2 hour session about everything I needed to know to contribute to Firefox and the amount of knowledge I gained was substantial.So I guess it would be safe to say that my contributions to Mozilla will also be in a larger scale from now on.</p>
